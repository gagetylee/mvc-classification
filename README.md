# %MVC Classification Model
This project implements a classification model to determine the maximum volunatry contraction percentage (%MVC) of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. The dataset used was collected from the biceps brachii of 12 patients at 10%, 30%, and 50% of maximum voluntary contraction. User metadata is explored through training data valuation techniques to gain insights into how an individualâ€™s characteristics impact model output. The results are used in discussing data-centric approachs to EMG collection.
